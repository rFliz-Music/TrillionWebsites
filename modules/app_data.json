However, DApps and Web3 apps have limitations, preventing them from being as widely adopted as client/server-based web applications (which many people associate with Web 2.0). As of 2025, some of the primary constraints are that Web3 apps are not integrated into most modern browsers, and it usually takes additional knowledge, extra steps, and software to run them.

As opposed to a location-based web protocol like HTTP/HTTPS, he proposed that IPFS would uniquely identify each file with a content ID. Benet founded Protocol Labs in May 2014 and with his team, launched IPFS in 2015. <br> Through IPFS, anyone on the network could publish and serve a file using the content address, and others could find and access the file from anyone else using a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table' target='_blank'>distributed hash table</a>, which stores metadata and content location information. If a person retrieves content online and caches it locally, those files can be accessed offline — which can be helpful especially for those with limited or intermitted internet connectivity. In the decade since its launch, IPFS has been used to curb censorship of the web in Catalonia and Turkey."

It is now a commercial web hosting and content management service that allows people to create their own websites, offering 1 gigabyte of file storage and 200 gigabytes of bandwidth for free per user. Neocities took part in a protest stunt against the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2014 to protest the FCC’s stance against net neutrality by throttling its bandwidth speeds when IPs from the agency tried to access Neocities. <br> Notably, Neocities was <a href='https://blog.neocities.org/blog/2015/09/08/its-time-for-the-distributed-web' target='_blank'>the first major site to implement IPFS</a> in 2015. The service hosted about 55,000 to 57,000 sites in 2015, and in 2025, Neocities reached over one million hosted sites. <br> The Neocities web page linked here, <i>Melonland</i>, was first published in 2016 and is an excellent example of a new generation of expressive personal websites that harkens back to the older generation of creative, GIF-full web pages."

                "text" : "By 2012, the World Wide Web had firmly established itself as an indispensable piece of open internet infrastructure for global human connection and knowledge. Meanwhile, governments, corporations, and other concentrated powers increasingly sought to <a href='https://www.eff.org/issues/coica-internet-censorship-and-copyright-bill' target='_blank'>censor and limit</a> people’s access to the web when it undermined their interests. Governments also saw the potential of web services to be used for surveillance. They secured this fate by passing <a href='https://www.eff.org/issues/cyber-security-legislation' target='_blank'>laws in the name of ‘cybersecurity’</a> and other rationales to make it easier for companies to disclose and share personal information with state agencies. In response to these and other threats on the web, there was a new concerted effort to build protocols and methods to further decentralize the web — and to make it impossible for any central authority to censor content, surveil people, or limit access. The most well-known and well-resourced of these efforts involved blockchain (AKA distributed ledger) technologies. At the same time, many other approaches to make the web more distributed, peer-to-peer, and local-first multiplied. Examples of peer-to-peer web protocols include <a href='https://ipfs.tech/' target='_blank'>InterPlanetary File System</a> (IPFS), <a href='https://webtorrent.io/' target='_blank'>WebTorrent</a>, and <a href='https://dat-ecosystem.org/' target='_blank'>Dat</a> — all of which were launched in this era."
